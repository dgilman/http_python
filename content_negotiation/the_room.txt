(JOHNNY STORMS ONTO THE ROOF WITH A WATER BOTTLE AND LOOKS
CONFUSED AND LOST. HE SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.)

I did not hit her. It's not true! It's bullshit, I did not
hit her. Why did Lisa say that? I would never do that!

(JOHNNY THROWS THE BOTTLE OF WATER TO THE GROUND.)

I did not hit her!

(JOHNNY PICKS UP A FOOTBALL FROM THE FLOOR AND TOSSES IT IN
THE AIR.)

Oh hi Mark. What's up with you?

                            MARK

Not much. I'm just sitting up here thinking about life. I
wonder if girls like to cheat like guys do?

                           JOHNNY

What makes you say that?

                            MARK

(MARK STANDS UP AND JOHNNY TOSSES THE BALL TO HIM.)

Well, I'm just thinking, you know.

                           JOHNNY

(THEY CONTINUE TO TOSS THE BALL WHILE THEY ARE TALKING.)

I don't have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me.

                            MARK

You never know. People are very strange this days. I used to
know a girl who had a dozen guys. One of them found out about
it, beat her up and she ended up in a hospital.

                           JOHNNY

What a story!
